      When using the \`src\` input property to load file remotely, language for syntax highlight will be auto-detected based on the loaded file extension.

      The following example...

      \`\`\`html
      <markdown [src]="'app/syntax-highlight/remote/for-loop.js'"></markdown>
      \`\`\`

      Would render with Javascript syntax highlight based on the \`js\` file extension.
