| User                 | The "user" refers to an individual who interacts with the platform to register an account, recover their account, or access their resources through an account.                             |
| Client               | The "client" is the application that is attempting to act on the user's behalf or access the user's resources.                                                                             |
| Resource Server      | The "resource server" is the application that contains the user's data, which the user or clients can access through APIs using credentials.                                                |

| Credentials          | Credentials include usernames, passwords, emails, phone numbers, access tokens, security tokens, codes, or cookies. These components serve the purpose of identifying users and authorizing access to specific resources. |
| API                  | The API (Application Programming Interface) acts as a communication channel between applications, enabling them to interact and exchange information with each other.                       |
